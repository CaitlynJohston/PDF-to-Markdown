# PDF-to-Markdown
Test documents for Markdown

- Here is the conversion tool I use for Markdown revisions: https://github.com/jzillmann/pdf-to-markdown.

*Workaround suggestion:* Here's how to use this PDF-to-Markdown page:
1. Drop a PDF file in this editor, and click EDIT
2. Strip out the MD it generates, then paste in the desired MD code.
3. Click on the PREVIEW button and it renders it correctly.
