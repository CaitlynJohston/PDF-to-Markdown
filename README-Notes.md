# PDF-to-Markdown
Test documents from WorkFusion
- I added copies of the source files for reference.
- I added copies of the files with TXT extensions because if you simply click on the MD files, Github doesn't render the HTML I added. Please feel free to download these and run them in a proper MD protocol so they display correctly.
- If you look at the text and MD files in a text editor, you'll see the HTML. 
- Here is the conversion tool I used: https://github.com/jzillmann/pdf-to-markdown.  I then edited the files in NotePad because it's more convenient for me than hunting down and installing Atom or some such thing and then figuring it out.

*Workaround suggestion:* Here's how to use this PDF-to-Markdown page to see my work:
1. Drop a PDF file in this editor, and click EDIT
2. Strip out the MD it generates, then paste my MD code in.
3. Click on the PREVIEW button and it renders it correctly.
